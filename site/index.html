      <div>Dear all,
      <span>I took this really cool course
      </span></div>
      <span>on Coursera.org. I think it's
      my favorite course I've EVER taken!
      Here is the URL for it:
      </span>
      <a href="...">HTML, CSS and JS for Web Developers</a>
      <div>
      Does anyone know how I can give this course 6
      out of 5 stars?
      </div>
      <div>
      Thank you,
      -Yaakov.... I mean a random student! Definitely not Yaakov.
